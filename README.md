# learn_python

## background
Python has been very crucial scripting language in the DevOps world. 

Actually I practiced python on multiple occations and passed numerous interviews. So I am defintely not newbie in python. 

but I feel that I forget it very soon because I don't use it a lot at work or at home. 

same with my markdown skillsets too (in fact, am referring cheatsheet now!)

I feel that the best way to gain these skills to get my hands dirty ALL THE TIME.

## objective
Therefore, am creating this repo to centrally store basic/medium/advanced code for years.

I hope ths repo not only contains basic syntax but also interesting project to solve real world problems.
